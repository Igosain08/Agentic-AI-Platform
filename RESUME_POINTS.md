# Resume Points for Agentic AI Platform

Use these bullet points on your resume to describe this project:

## Project Description

**Agentic AI Platform** - Production-Ready Multi-Agent System with MCP Integration
- Built a production-grade AI agent platform using LangGraph and LangChain, featuring multi-agent orchestration, tool use, and database integration via Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Implemented a scalable FastAPI-based REST API with async support, comprehensive error handling, and OpenAPI documentation
- Integrated Couchbase database through MCP, enabling AI agents to query and analyze data using natural language

## Technical Achievements

**Architecture & Design:**
- Designed and implemented a multi-agent orchestration system with specialized agent roles (Query, Data, Format)
- Built a modular, extensible architecture supporting multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Nebius) via LiteLLM
- Implemented Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration for standardized tool and data source connectivity

**Backend Development:**
- Developed production-ready Python application with async/await patterns, type hints, and comprehensive error handling
- Implemented Redis-based caching layer with TTL and intelligent cache invalidation strategies
- Built rate limiting, request validation, and structured logging using structlog and Prometheus metrics

**DevOps & Infrastructure:**
- Set up CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions for automated testing, linting, and Docker image building
- Containerized application with multi-stage Docker builds and docker-compose for local development
- Configured comprehensive test suite with unit, integration, and E2E tests achieving high code coverage

**Database & Integration:**
- Integrated Couchbase Capella cloud database with connection pooling and query optimization
- Implemented SQL++ query generation and execution through MCP tools
- Built agent memory management with thread-based conversation context isolation

## Technologies Used

- **Languages**: Python 3.12, SQL++
- **Frameworks**: FastAPI, LangChain, LangGraph, Pydantic

- **Databases**: Couchbase Capella, Redis
- **DevOps**: Docker, GitHub Actions, Prometheus, structlog
- **Protocols**: Model Context Protocol (MCP), REST API, OpenAPI

## Key Metrics & Results

- Successfully orchestrated multiple specialized AI agents for complex query processing
- Achieved sub-2 second response times for cached queries, <15 seconds for database queries
- Implemented comprehensive error handling and retry logic for production reliability
- Built extensible architecture supporting multiple MCP servers and LLM providers

# 🚀 Project Highlights for Resume

## One-Line Summary
**Production-ready multi-agent AI platform** with LangGraph orchestration, MCP integration, and enterprise-grade DevOps practices.

## Key Achievements (Bullet Points)

### Architecture & Design
- ✅ Designed multi-agent orchestration system with specialized agent roles (Query, Data, Format)
- ✅ Built modular, extensible architecture supporting multiple LLM providers via LiteLLM
- ✅ Implemented Model Context Protocol (MCP) for standardized tool and data source connectivity
- ✅ Created scalable FastAPI-based REST API with async/await patterns and comprehensive error handling

### Backend Development
- ✅ Developed production-ready Python application with type hints, structured logging, and monitoring
- ✅ Implemented Redis-based caching layer with TTL and intelligent cache invalidation
- ✅ Built rate limiting, request validation, and Prometheus metrics integration
- ✅ Integrated Couchbase Capella cloud database with connection pooling and query optimization

### DevOps & Infrastructure
- ✅ Set up CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions (automated testing, linting, Docker builds)
- ✅ Containerized application with multi-stage Docker builds and docker-compose
- ✅ Configured comprehensive test suite (unit, integration, E2E) with high code coverage
- ✅ Implemented structured logging, metrics collection, and health check endpoints

### AI/ML Engineering
- ✅ Built ReAct agents using LangGraph for reasoning and tool selection
- ✅ Implemented agent memory management with thread-based conversation context
- ✅ Created SQL++ query generation and execution through MCP tools
- ✅ Designed prompt engineering system for multi-turn conversations
